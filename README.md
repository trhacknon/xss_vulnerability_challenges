# XSS Vulnerability Scenarios (challenges)
This repository is a Dockerized php application containing some XSS vulnerability challenges.<br>
The ideas behind challenges are:</br>
* Javascript validation bypass
* html entities bypass
* WAF bypass
* Black-list validation bypass
* Basic XSS validation bypass
* Double encode bypass of WAF to exploit XSS
* Exploiting XSS by bypassing escape characters


# Quick Start Using Docker
**Using docker hub (Quickest):**
1. To access the challenges, you need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">docker</a> installed.</br>
2. Run this command to pull and run the image from docker hub:</br>`sudo docker run -d -p 9003:80 moeinfatehi/xss_vulnerability_challenges`
3. Access the challenges with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9003">http://localhost:9003</a></br></br>

Help:
```
-d: detached mode (You can use terminal after running command
-p: specifies port (you can change 8008 to whatever you want. If you don't have a web server on your host, set it to 80)
```

**Using docker-compose:**  
1. To access the challenges, you need <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a> installed.</br>
2. Clone the repository</br>`git clone https://github.com/trhacknon/xss_vulnerability_challenges.git`
3. Open the main directory of the project (where docker-compose.yml file exists) and run: `docker-compose up`
4. Access the challenges with this URL: <a href="http://localhost:9003">http://localhost:9003</a>
